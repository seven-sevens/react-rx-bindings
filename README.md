# react-rx-bindings

A small, reactive, MVVM library with no dependencies. Only peer dependencies are 

`react` +16.8.0 and 

`rxjs` +5.0.0

# Features

* Small and lightweight.
* Separates business logic from UI code using MVVM.
* Focus on managing individual components, not the entire application.
* UI can be derived from local state.
* Plays nice with `Redux` and other state management libraries.

# Installation

The easiest way to install is with npm.

`npm i react-rx-bindings`

The entire implementation is in `index.ts` so you can also just copy and paste the code into your project if you do not want
to use npm.
